            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate web developer who began my journey with FreeCodeCamp, and it has been a life-changing experience. When I first started, I had no prior knowledge of web development, but the structured lessons and hands-on projects provided a solid foundation for my learning. From mastering HTML and CSS to diving deep into JavaScript, APIs, and even full-stack development, FreeCodeCamp has equipped me with the skills to create meaningful and impactful web applications.

                One of the highlights of my journey has been earning certifications for Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms, Front-End Libraries, and Back-End Development. Each project I completed challenged me to think critically and apply problem-solving skills, preparing me for real-world scenarios.
                
                I take pride in being part of a global community of learners who constantly support each other. Through this platform, I not only learned the technical aspects of web development but also gained valuable insights into collaboration, perseverance, and continuous improvement.
                
                Today, I strive to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My projects reflect my growth as a developer and my passion for building solutions that make a difference. Whether it's a portfolio site, a game, or a full-stack application, my focus is on creating exceptional digital experiences.</p>
