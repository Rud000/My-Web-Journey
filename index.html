            <h2>Discover the Journey</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my web development journey. Explore my experiences, learnings, and creations.
                Starting my web development journey was one of the most thrilling and challenging experiences of my life. Initially, I didn't know where to begin, but FreeCodeCamp became my first guide. Its well-structured curriculum and projects were invaluable, and completing them gave me confidence.

One of the biggest hurdles I faced was hosting my first website. I used free services like GitHub Pages and Netlify at first, both of which were lifesavers for someone just starting out. Eventually, I explored other options like paid hosting providers and learned about domain registrations.

Debugging was another challenge. At times, fixing a minor CSS issue would take hours, but I slowly learned to use developer tools effectively. The community was also incredibly supportive. Platforms like Stack Overflow and Reddit helped me find answers whenever I was stuck.

Creating projects was the most rewarding part. From small JavaScript-based games to a fully functional blog site, I pushed myself to explore both front-end and back-end technologies. It was a joy to see my skills improve over time. My journey has been all about persistence, learning, and passion for creating something meaningful on the web.
